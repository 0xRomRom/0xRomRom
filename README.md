- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m @0xRomRom
I've started my coding journey in december of 2021.
I've build a few projects so far using HTML and CSS in the first month.
I'm currently working my ways through vanilla JS to master the core technologies before I moved on to frameworks, preprocessors, libraries etc.
My goal for 2022 is to break my foot into tech starting off as a junior front end developer!
